# Cooperative Graph Neural Network (CoGNN)

## Overview

This repository implements a **Cooperative Graph Neural Network (CoGNN)** designed to tackle benchmark graph learning tasks. 
The model combines principles of cooperation and competition among neural units to improve performance on challenging 
datasets while maintaining computational efficiency.

By leveraging cooperative learning paradigms, CoGNN optimizes information flow across graph structures, making it particularly 
suited for applications requiring fine-grained node and edge predictions.

## Features

- **Cooperative Neural Network Architecture**: A novel framework combining cooperation and traditional GNN mechanisms.
- **Benchmark Dataset Evaluation**: Supports evaluation on widely-used datasets such as:
  - Cora
  - Citeseer
  - PubMed
  - ogbn-arxiv
- **Highly Modular Implementation**: Easily extendable to custom datasets and use cases.
- **Performance Metrics**: Integrated tools to measure and compare accuracy, F1-score, precision, and recall.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python >= 3.8
- PyTorch >= 1.10
- PyTorch Geometric
- NetworkX

### Setup

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/username/CoGNN.git
   cd CoGNN
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment and activate it:
   ```bash
   python -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

### Train the Model

Run the following command to train CoGNN on a benchmark dataset:
```bash
python train.py --dataset cora --epochs 100 --learning_rate 0.01
```

### Evaluate the Model

To evaluate the model on a specific dataset:
```bash
python evaluate.py --dataset citeseer
```
